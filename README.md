Test Execution Steps
Prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK):
   - Ensure that JDK 8 or above is installed on your machine.
   - Set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

2. Maven:
   - Install Maven to manage dependencies and build the project.
   - Ensure that Maven is added to your systemâ€™s `PATH`.

3. IDE:
   - Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running the test scripts.

4. Browser:
   - Ensure that the web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) you plan to test is installed.
   - Download the corresponding WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).

5. Cloning the Repository:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using:
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
     cd repo-name
 
Setting Up the Project:

1. Open the Project in Your IDE:
   - Open the cloned project in your preferred IDE.

2. Install Dependencies:
   - The `pom.xml` file is configured with all necessary dependencies. Ensure that all the dependencies have been installed into your system.

3. Configure WebDriver:
   - Ensure that the WebDriver executable (e.g., `chromedriver.exe` for Chrome) is available in the system's `PATH`. WebDriverManager dependency have been used to manage all the browser     drivers.

Running the Tests:

1. Run All Tests:
   - You can run all test scripts together by using the Master.xml file, which consists of the test scenario (TC_001_Login_Test) with all the test cases.

3. Test Reports:
   - After executing the tests, you can find the test report in the `reports` folder. The report generated is Extent Report implemented through ExtentReportManager.java file and listeners.

Assumptions:

- Environment Setup: It is assumed that the test environment (browser, WebDriver, etc.) is set up and configured correctly on the machine where the tests will be executed.
- Test Data: Valid and invalid credentials are assumed to be available and configured by random generation through java.
- Network Availability: The test scripts assume a stable internet connection for accessing the web application.
- Application Stability: It is assumed that the web application under test is stable and running during the test execution.
